    <h1>The Partisan Divide</h1>
    <h2>Since Donald Trump's presidency and the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has seen an increase in the partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans. </h2>
    <h3>By Micaela Hanson</h3>
    <p>A 2021 survey of registered voters found that Democrats and Republicans have different ideas for which issues President Biden and Congress should focus on. In recent years, there has been a growing partisan divide amongst Americans that is further expressed in this survey. There were 1,405 total responses for the survey conducted in March 2021. </p>
