, Photo 2: A view of the Dead Sea's receding shoreline on Nov. 5. The water level is dropping close to 4 feet every year. The main part of the lake is now around 950 feet deep — about 15% shallower, and a third of the surface area, compared to its shape half a century ago., Photo 3: Gregory, a recent immigrant from Russia, floats in the Dead Sea at a beach connected to an Israeli hotel resort on Nov. 10. The water of the lake is so full of salt that bathers float right to the top., Photo 4: Tourists bathe in the Dead Sea near an Israeli hotel resort on Nov. 10. The lake's southern basin, where Israel's resorts are located, is actually an artificial evaporation pool of Dead Sea water maintained by the Dead Sea Works, an Israeli chemical company that extracts minerals from the lake's water.
