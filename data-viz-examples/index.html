    <h1>Policing Effect on Minorities</h1>
    <h2>A Closer Look at Policing and its Relation to Minorities</h2>
    <h3>By Jalyn Mathis</h3>
    <p>This looks at the American policing effect on minority communities and how people view the police department in America. This shows rate of people killed by police by race and ethnicity, the public opinion of police and the amount of non-white people in police agencies. The lack of representation in the police department and the high mortality rate of Black people killed by police are factors that can shape the public view on policing in America.</p>
